# Corpus Gateway

Unified entry point for all hiivmind-corpus operations.

**User request:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 1: Check for Arguments

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty** → Go directly to **Mode: Interactive Menu** (no introspection needed first)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided** → Continue to Step 2: Intent Detection

---

## Step 2: Intent Detection (only when arguments provided)

Analyze intent using these patterns:

### Intent → Skill Mapping

| Intent Keywords | Primary Skill | Secondary Skills |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| create, new, index, set up, scaffold, initialize, start | `init` | Often followed by `build` |
| add, include, import, fetch, clone, source | `add-source` | May trigger `build` |
| build, analyze, create index, scan, index | `build` | - |
| expand, deepen, more detail, enhance, elaborate | `enhance` | - |
| update, refresh, sync, check, upstream, stale | `refresh` | May trigger `enhance` |
| upgrade, migrate, latest, standards, template | `upgrade` | - |
| status, info, up to date, current | `refresh` (status mode) | - |
| navigate, find, search, look up, what does, how do | `navigate` | - |
| list, show, available, installed, discover | Discovery mode | - |

### Compound Intent Detection

Some requests imply multiple skills - use TodoWrite to track:

| Request Pattern | Skill Sequence |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "index {project} docs" (not in corpus) | init → build |
| "add {source} and include in index" | add-source → build (partial) |
| "refresh and expand {section}" | refresh → enhance |
| "create corpus with {source1} and {source2}" | init → add-source → build |
| "set up {project} with blog posts too" | init → add-source (web) → build |

---

## Step 3: Context Detection (only when needed for routing)

When arguments are provided and context matters for routing, detect:

```bash
# Only run these when needed to determine valid operations
test -f data/config.yaml && echo "IN_CORPUS=true"
test -f .claude-plugin/marketplace.json && echo "IN_MARKETPLACE=true"
ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null && echo "IN_PROJECT=true"
```

### Context + Intent Matrix

| Context | init | add-source | build | enhance | refresh | upgrade | navigate |
|---------|------|------------|-------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| In corpus directory | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| In marketplace | ✅ (add) | Via child | Via child | Via child | Via child | ✅ (batch) | Via child |
| In project (no corpus) | ✅ | After init | After init | After build | After build | ❌ | ❌ |
| Fresh directory | ✅ | After init | After init | After build | After build | ❌ | ❌ |
| Has installed corpora | Ask which | Ask which | Ask which | Ask which | Ask which | Ask which | Ask which |

---

## Step 4: Routing

Based on detected intent, route appropriately:

### Single Skill Dispatch

Load the appropriate skill with context:

```markdown
**Context**: {detected context}
**Intent**: {detected intent}
**Target corpus**: {corpus name if identified}
**Location**: {corpus path if known}

Loading {skill-name} skill...
```

### Multi-Skill Orchestration

For compound intents, create a workflow with TodoWrite:

```markdown
## Workflow: {Goal Description}

1. [ ] {First skill action}
2. [ ] {Second skill action}
3. [ ] {Third skill action}
4. [ ] Verify and suggest next steps
```

Then execute skills sequentially:
1. **Complete current skill's workflow** - Don't interrupt mid-skill
2. **Summarize what was done** - "Corpus structure created at X"
3. **Transition naturally** - "Now let's build the index"
4. **Load next skill** - Use Skill tool to load next skill
5. **Continue with context** - Pass relevant info to next skill

### Ambiguity Resolution

When intent is unclear, ask using AskUserQuestion:

```
I'm not sure what you'd like to do. Which of these fits?

1. **Create new corpus** - Set up documentation indexing for a project
2. **Add sources** - Include additional repos, files, or web pages
3. **Build/rebuild index** - Analyze docs and create the index
4. **Enhance coverage** - Add more detail to specific topics
5. **Refresh from upstream** - Check for and apply doc updates
6. **Upgrade structure** - Apply latest corpus template standards
7. **Navigate/search** - Ask questions about existing corpora
```

---

## Mode: Interactive Menu (No Arguments)

When invoked without arguments, **ask what the user wants first** before doing any discovery or introspection.

### Step 1: Ask Intent First

Use AskUserQuestion immediately:

```
What would you like to do?

1. **Navigate a corpus** - Ask questions about installed documentation
2. **Create a new corpus** - Index documentation for a project
3. **Manage existing corpus** - Refresh, enhance, or check status
4. **List installed corpora** - See what's available
```

### Step 2: Route Based on Selection

**If "Navigate a corpus"**:
1. Now discover installed corpora (see Discovery Commands below)
2. Present list of built corpora
3. Ask which corpus to query
4. Load `hiivmind-corpus-navigate` skill

**If "Create a new corpus"**:
1. Load `hiivmind-corpus-init` skill directly
2. No discovery needed

**If "Manage existing corpus"**:
1. Now discover installed corpora
2. Present list with status indicators
3. Ask which corpus and what action (refresh, enhance, upgrade)

**If "List installed corpora"**:
1. Now discover and display all corpora with status

### Discovery Commands (only run when needed)

Use simple for loops with `basename` (avoid `${d##*/}` which fails with trailing slashes):

```bash
# User-level corpora
for d in ~/.claude/skills/hiivmind-corpus-*/; do
  [ -d "$d" ] || continue
  name=$(basename "$d")
  echo "user-level|$name|$d"
done

# Repo-local corpora
for d in .claude-plugin/skills/hiivmind-corpus-*/; do
  [ -d "$d" ] || continue
  name=$(basename "$d")
  echo "repo-local|$name|$d"
done

# Marketplace corpora (multi-corpus marketplaces)
for d in ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/hiivmind-corpus-*/; do
  [ -d "$d" ] || continue
  name=$(basename "$d")
  echo "marketplace|$name|$d"
done
```

### Status Detection (only when listing or managing)

For each corpus, determine status:
- **placeholder**: index.md contains "Run hiivmind-corpus-build"
- **built**: index.md has real entries
- **stale**: local clone HEAD differs from indexed SHA

### Corpus Action Menu

After corpus selection for management, show actions:

**For built/stale corpora:**
- Navigate - Ask questions about this documentation
- Check freshness - See if the source has updates
- Enhance - Add more depth to specific topics
- Refresh - Sync index with upstream changes

**For placeholder corpora:**
- Build now - Create the index collaboratively
- Add sources - Add more documentation sources first

## Context-Aware Responses

### In Corpus Directory

```
You're in the hiivmind-corpus-polars corpus. What would you like to do?

- Navigate: Ask questions about Polars documentation
- Refresh: Check for upstream updates
- Enhance: Add more detail to specific topics
- Add sources: Include additional documentation
```

### In Marketplace with Multiple Corpora

```
This marketplace contains 4 corpora:
- hiivmind-corpus-polars
- hiivmind-corpus-ibis
- hiivmind-corpus-narwhals
- hiivmind-corpus-substrait

Which one would you like to work with? (Or "all" for batch operations)
```

### In Project Without Corpus

```
This looks like a {detected type} project. Would you like to:

1. **Create a repo-local corpus** - Team sharing via git
2. **Create a user-level corpus** - Personal use across projects
3. **Check for existing corpora** - See what's already installed
```

## Example Sessions

### Natural Language: New Corpus

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus index the polars python library`

**Response:**
```
I'll help you create a Polars documentation corpus.

## Workflow: Index Polars Documentation

1. [ ] Initialize corpus structure
2. [ ] Build documentation index

Loading hiivmind-corpus-init skill...
```

### Natural Language: Enhancement

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus I need more detail on the lazy API`

**Response:**
```
You're in the Polars corpus. I'll help enhance the lazy API coverage.

Loading hiivmind-corpus-enhance skill...

Target: lazy API section
```

### Natural Language: Status Check

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus is my polars corpus up to date?`

**Response:**
```
Checking status of your Polars corpus...

Loading hiivmind-corpus-refresh skill (status mode)...
```

### Natural Language: Multi-Source Setup

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus set up react docs with kent's testing blog too`

**Response:**
```
I'll create a React corpus with both the official docs and Kent's blog.

## Workflow: Create React Corpus with Multiple Sources

1. [ ] Initialize corpus structure
2. [ ] Clone React docs repo
3. [ ] Add Kent's testing blog (web source)
4. [ ] Build combined index

Loading hiivmind-corpus-init skill...
```

### No Arguments: Interactive Menu

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus`

**Response:**
```
What would you like to do with documentation corpora?

**Installed corpora:**
- hiivmind-corpus-polars (✓ built) - Polars DataFrame documentation
- hiivmind-corpus-ibis (✓ built) - Ibis SQL expressions
- hiivmind-corpus-github (⚠ stale) - GitHub API and Actions

**Quick actions:**
1. Select a corpus to navigate or manage
2. Create a new corpus
3. Refresh all stale corpora (1 stale)
```

---

## Error Handling

**No corpora and no clear intent:**
```
No documentation corpora are installed yet.

Would you like to:
1. **Create a new corpus** - Index documentation for a project
2. **Install from marketplace** - `/plugin install hiivmind-corpus-polars@hiivmind`

Or describe what you'd like to index: "/hiivmind-corpus index the react docs"
```

**Unrecognized project/library:**
```
I'm not familiar with "{project}". Could you provide:
1. The GitHub repository URL, or
2. The documentation website URL

I'll help set up a corpus from there.
```

**Conflicting context:**
```
You're already in the hiivmind-corpus-polars corpus.

Did you mean to:
1. Work with this corpus (navigate, enhance, refresh)
2. Create a different corpus elsewhere
3. Something else?
```

## Notes

- **Natural language first**: Describe your goal and the command routes automatically
- **Menu fallback**: No arguments shows interactive corpus selection
- **Multi-skill orchestration**: Compound requests chain skills with progress tracking
- **Context-aware**: Adapts suggestions based on current directory
- Uses `hiivmind-corpus-discover` logic for finding installed corpora
- Uses `hiivmind-corpus-navigate` for documentation queries
