# {{project_display_name}} Corpus Navigator

Find and retrieve relevant documentation from the {{project_display_name}} corpus.

## Process

1. **Search the indexes first** (see Index Search section below)
   - Extract key concepts from the question
   - Grep the indexes for those terms
   - If matches found → use those entries directly
2. **If no search matches, navigate by section**:
   - Read the index: `data/index.md`
   - Check for tiered index (if main index links to sub-indexes like `→ See [index-actions.md]`)
   - Find relevant section and read sub-index if tiered
3. **Parse path format**: `{source_id}:{relative_path}`
4. **Check for `⚡ GREP` marker** - if present, use Grep instead of Read (see Large Structured Files section)
5. **Look up source** in `data/config.yaml` by ID
6. **Get content** based on source type (see Source Access below)
7. **Answer** with citation to source and file path

## Index Search (Recommended First Step)

**Before reading sections sequentially, SEARCH the indexes for relevant terms.**

### Step 1: Extract Key Concepts

Analyze the user's question and extract:
- **Explicit terms**: Words directly used in the question
- **Synonyms**: Related terms (e.g., "filter" → also try "view", "query", "search")
- **Domain terms**: Technical concepts that might appear in docs (e.g., "tag" → also try "label", "field")

Example: "How do I filter GitHub projects by tag?"
- Explicit: `filter`, `projects`, `tag`
- Synonyms: `view`, `query`, `search`
- Domain: `label`, `field`, `custom field`

### Step 2: Search All Index Files

```bash
# Search for each term across all index files
grep -ri "filter" data/ --include="*.md"
grep -ri "tag" data/ --include="*.md"
grep -ri "label" data/ --include="*.md"
```

**Tip:** Search for the most specific term first. If no matches, broaden to synonyms.

### Step 3: Use Search Results

If grep finds matches:
1. **Direct hit**: Entry description matches the question → use that path
2. **Related hit**: Entry is in the right area but doesn't directly answer → **GO TO STEP 4 IMMEDIATELY**
3. **No hit in index**: The topic may not be indexed → **GO TO STEP 4 IMMEDIATELY**

**IMPORTANT:** If you searched for "filter" and only found "Views & Layouts" without "filter" in the description, that's a **related hit, not a direct hit**. Stop and ask the user before exploring further.

**CRITICAL: Use the EXACT path from the index!**

When you find an index entry like:
```
- **Views & Layouts** `docs:issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md`
```

You MUST fetch exactly: `issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md`

**NEVER guess or invent filenames** like `filtering-projects.md` - if it's not in the index, it doesn't exist as far as you know. The index IS the source of truth for what files are available.

### Step 4: Clarify Before Exploring (IMPORTANT!)

**STOP HERE if you only found related content, not a direct answer.**

Don't start exploring, guessing paths, or searching the source files. Instead, **use AskUserQuestion** to clarify:

**Present these options:**

1. **Clarify the request** - Maybe the question can be rephrased
   - "Could you rephrase your question? I searched for '{terms}' but found no matches."
   - Suggest alternative terms: "Did you mean '{synonym}' or '{related_term}'?"

2. **Show what's available** - Help the user find related content
   - "The closest sections I found are: {list nearby sections}"
   - "Would any of these help: {list related entries}?"

3. **Identify an index gap** - If the user confirms their request was valid
   - "This topic isn't covered in the current index."
   - Offer next steps:
     - `hiivmind-corpus-enhance` - Add depth to a specific topic area
     - `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` - Add another documentation source
     - `hiivmind-corpus-refresh` - Check if upstream docs have new content

**Example response:**

> I searched the index for "filtering", "views", and "projects" but found no direct matches.
>
> **Options:**
> 1. **Rephrase**: Did you mean "customizing views" or "project settings"?
> 2. **Related sections**: The "Projects" section covers Views & Layouts, Fields, and Automations
> 3. **Index gap**: If you expected this topic to be covered, the index may need:
>    - Enhancing with `hiivmind-corpus-enhance` for more depth
>    - A new source added with `hiivmind-corpus-add-source`
>
> Which would you like to explore?

## Tiered Index Navigation

Large corpora may use **tiered indexes** with a main index linking to detailed sub-indexes:

```
data/
├── index.md              # Main index with section summaries
├── index-actions.md      # Detailed: GitHub Actions
├── index-rest-api.md     # Detailed: REST API
└── index-graphql.md      # Detailed: GraphQL
```

**How to navigate:**

1. **Start with main index** (`data/index.md`)
2. **Identify the relevant section** from user's question
3. **If section links to sub-index** (e.g., `→ See [index-actions.md](index-actions.md)`):
   - Read that sub-index for detailed entries
   - The sub-index has the actual file paths
4. **Quick Reference entries** in main index have direct paths - use those for common lookups

**Example flow:**
- User asks: "How do I set up a self-hosted runner?"
- Read `data/index.md` → find "Actions & CI/CD" section → links to `index-actions.md`
- Read `data/index-actions.md` → find "Runners" section → find self-hosted runner entry
- Fetch the actual doc file using the path

## Path Format

Index entries use the format: `{source_id}:{relative_path}`

Examples:
- `{{source_id}}:reference/hooks.md` - Git source
- `local:team-standards/coding-guidelines.md` - Local uploads
- `web:blog-posts/article-name.md` - Cached web content

## Source Access

### Worked Example (IMPORTANT - Follow This Pattern!)

**Index entry found:** `docs:issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md`

**Step 1 - Parse the path:**
- `source_id` = `docs` (everything before the colon)
- `relative_path` = `issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md` (everything after the colon)

**Step 2 - Look up source in config.yaml:**
```yaml
sources:
  - id: docs
    type: git
    repo_owner: github
    repo_name: docs
    branch: main
    docs_root: content
```

**Step 3 - Construct the full path:**
- Local clone: `.source/docs/content/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md`
- GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/docs/main/content/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views/index.md`

**CRITICAL:** The `relative_path` from the index is used EXACTLY as-is. NEVER invent or guess filenames!

### For git sources

**Step 1 - Check for local clone:**
Use Glob or Bash to check if `.source/{source_id}/` exists.

**Step 2a - If local clone exists (PREFERRED):**
Read directly from `.source/{source_id}/{docs_root}/{relative_path}` using the Read tool.
This is faster and works offline.

**Step 2b - If NO local clone exists (fallback only):**
Fetch from GitHub using the EXACT path from the index:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/{branch}/{docs_root}/{relative_path}
```
Use WebFetch to retrieve content.

**Tip:** If web fetching is slow or unreliable, suggest cloning locally:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 {repo_url} .source/{source_id}
```
This improves performance and enables offline access.

**Staleness check for git sources:**
After reading, compare the source's `last_commit_sha` in config to the local clone:
```bash
cd .source/{source_id} && git rev-parse HEAD
```
If clone is **newer** than indexed SHA → warn user: "The docs have been updated since the index was built. Consider running refresh to update the index."

### For local sources

Read directly from: `data/uploads/{source_id}/{path}`

Local sources are user-uploaded files stored within the corpus.

### For web sources

Read from cache: `.cache/web/{source_id}/{cached_file}`

If cache miss, look up the URL in `data/config.yaml` and fetch fresh content.

## File Locations

- **Index**: `data/index.md`
- **Config**: `data/config.yaml` (has sources array with per-source tracking)
- **Git sources**: `.source/{source_id}/` (cloned repos, gitignored)
- **Local sources**: `data/uploads/{source_id}/` (user-uploaded files)
- **Web cache**: `.cache/web/{source_id}/` (fetched web content, gitignored)

## Large Structured Files (schemas, specs, configs)

For large files like GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs, or JSON configs, **DO NOT read the entire file**. Use Grep to search precisely:

**GraphQL Schema patterns:**
```bash
# Find a type definition
grep -n "^type Repository " schema.graphql -A 30

# Find an input type
grep -n "^input CreateIssueInput " schema.graphql -A 20

# Find a mutation
grep -n "createIssue" schema.graphql -B 2 -A 15

# Find all fields returning a specific type
grep -n ": Repository" schema.graphql

# Find enum values
grep -n "^enum IssueState " schema.graphql -A 10
```

**OpenAPI/Swagger patterns:**
```bash
# Find an endpoint
grep -n "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues" openapi.yaml -A 30

# Find a schema definition
grep -n "^  Issue:" openapi.yaml -A 40
```

**General patterns:**
```bash
# Find definition with context
grep -n "^{keyword}" file -A 20

# Find all references to something
grep -n "{keyword}" file

# Case-insensitive search
grep -ni "{keyword}" file
```

**When to use Grep vs Read:**
- File > 1000 lines → prefer Grep
- Looking for specific definition → Grep with `-A` context
- Need surrounding context → Grep with `-B` and `-A`
- Need to understand overall structure → Read first 100 lines, then Grep

## Output

- Cite the source ID and file path for reference
- Include code examples from the docs
- Suggest related docs from the same index section
- Note source type and freshness warnings if relevant

## Making Projects Aware of This Corpus

If you're working in a project that uses {{project_display_name}} but doesn't know about this corpus, you can add awareness to the project's CLAUDE.md.

**The `data/project-awareness.md` file** contains a ready-to-use snippet that can be added to any project's CLAUDE.md to make Claude aware of this corpus when working in that project.

### How to Inject

1. Read `data/project-awareness.md` from this corpus
2. Add its contents to the target project's CLAUDE.md (create if needed)
3. The project will now know to use this corpus for {{project_display_name}} questions

### When to Suggest Injection

Suggest adding project awareness when:
- User is working in a project that heavily uses {{project_display_name}}
- User repeatedly asks {{project_display_name}} questions without invoking the corpus
- User says "I keep forgetting to use the docs"

Example suggestion:
> "I notice this project uses {{project_display_name}} extensively. Would you like me to add corpus awareness to this project's CLAUDE.md? That way I'll automatically know to check the {{project_display_name}} docs when working here."
