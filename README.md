# Documentation Navigation Skills

Claude Code skills for indexing and navigating open source project documentation.

## What is a "meta-skill"?

This is a skill that **creates other skills**.

Most Claude Code skills help you do something directly—write code, search files, fetch data. This plugin is different: it helps you **build custom skills** for navigating any project's documentation.

     Prisma docs            ClickHouse docs        React docs
```

The skills you generate are:
- **Persistent** — committed to your repo, survive across sessions
- **Tailored** — built collaboratively around your actual use case
- **Maintainable** — track upstream changes, know when they're stale

Think of it as a skill factory: you feed it a documentation source, and it produces a specialized navigation skill for that project.

## Two ways to create documentation skills

When you run `docs-plugin-init`, you'll choose where the skill should live:

### Project-local skill

```
your-project/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── skills/
│       └── polars-docs/      ← Created here
│           ├── SKILL.md
│           └── data/
└── src/
    └── analysis.py
```

**Best for:**
- A specific project that needs library docs (e.g., data analysis project needing Polars)
- Teams—everyone who clones the repo automatically gets the skill
- No marketplace installation required

**Example use case:** "I'm building a data pipeline and need quick access to Polars documentation while I work."

### Standalone plugin

```
polars-docs/                   ← Created as separate directory/repo
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── skills/navigate/
├── data/
└── README.md
```

**Best for:**
- Personal reuse across all your projects
- Sharing via the Claude Code marketplace
- Documentation you always want available

**Example use case:** "I work with React constantly—I want React docs available in every project."

| Aspect | Project-local | Standalone |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Location | `.claude-plugin/skills/{name}/` | `{name}/` separate repo |
| Installation | None—just open the project | Marketplace install required |
| Scope | This project only | All your projects |
| Team sharing | Automatic (via git) | Each person installs |
| Maintenance | Tied to project lifecycle | Independent lifecycle |

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add hiivmind/hiivmind-skills-documentation-navigation

# Install the plugin
/plugin install documentation-skills@hiivmind-skills-documentation-navigation
```

## Overview

This plugin provides skills to:
- Generate documentation plugins for any open source project
- Build collaborative, human-readable indexes
- Keep indexes in sync with upstream changes
- Navigate docs with or without a local clone

## Why use this?

### The problem with default documentation lookup

Without structured indexing, Claude investigates libraries by:

1. **Relying on training data** - May be outdated or incomplete
2. **Web searching** - Hit-or-miss, often finds outdated tutorials
3. **Fetching URLs on demand** - One page at a time, no context
4. **Reading installed packages** - Limited to code, not prose docs

**This means:**
- Rediscovering the same things every session
- No memory of what's relevant to *your* work
- Search results aren't curated
- Large doc sites are hard to navigate systematically
- Training cutoff means stale knowledge for fast-moving projects

### What this skill suite provides

| Capability | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| **Curated index** | Built collaboratively around your actual use case |
| **Persistent** | Committed to repo, survives across sessions |
| **Current** | Tracks upstream commits, knows when it's stale |
| **Structured** | Systematically find relevant sections |
| **Flexible** | Works with local clone or remote fetch |

### When to use this vs. default lookup

**Use this skill suite when:**
- Documentation is large (100+ pages)
- You have specific, recurring needs (not one-off questions)
- Docs change frequently
- Official docs are the authoritative source

**Default lookup is fine when:**
- Quick one-off question
- Small library with simple docs
- Just need a code snippet
- Docs are stable and well-known

### The real win

The collaborative index building. Rather than Claude guessing what matters, you tell it: "I care about data modeling and ETL, skip the deployment stuff." That context persists across sessions.

## Structure

```
.
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json              # Root plugin manifest
├── skills/
│   ├── docs-plugin-init/        # Create new doc plugins
│   ├── docs-initial-analysis/   # Analyze docs, build index
│   ├── docs-enhance/            # Deepen specific topics
│   └── docs-refresh/            # Refresh from upstream changes
├── templates/                   # Templates for generated plugins
└── docs/                        # Specifications
```

## Workflow

```
docs-plugin-init  →  docs-initial-analysis  →  docs-refresh
  (structure)             (index)               (upstream diff)
                             ↓
                       docs-enhance
                      (deepen topics)
```

| Skill | When | What |
|-------|------|------|
| `docs-plugin-init` | Once per project | Creates folder structure, config, navigate skill |
| `docs-initial-analysis` | Once per documentation source | Analyzes docs, builds index collaboratively with user |
| `docs-enhance` | As needed | Expands coverage on specific topics in existing index |
| `docs-refresh` | Ongoing | Compares upstream diff, refreshes index when needed |

## Usage

### Create a new documentation plugin

```
"Create a docs plugin for ClickHouse"
```

This will:
1. Clone the docs repo temporarily
2. Analyze structure (framework, file types, organization)
3. Generate `clickhouse-docs/` with config and navigate skill

### Initialize the index

```
"Initialize the clickhouse-docs index"
```

This will:
1. Clone source to `.source/`
2. Scan and present the structure
3. Ask about your use case and priorities
4. Build `index.md` collaboratively
5. Save commit SHA for change tracking

### Navigate documentation

```
"How do I set up Prisma migrations?"
```

The per-project navigate skill will:
1. Search the index for relevant docs
2. Fetch content (local or remote)
3. Answer with citations

### Enhance a topic

```
"Enhance the Query Optimization section in clickhouse-docs"
"I need more detail on migrations in prisma-docs"
```

This will:
1. Read the current index
2. Ask what you need from that topic
3. Explore docs for additional relevant content
4. Collaboratively expand the section

### Update from upstream

```
"Check if clickhouse-docs needs updating"
"Update the clickhouse-docs index"
```

## Design Principles

**Human-readable indexes**: Simple markdown with heading hierarchy, not complex YAML schemas.

**Collaborative building**: The index is built interactively based on user needs, not auto-generated.

**Works without local clone**: Navigate skill can fetch from raw GitHub URLs when `.source/` doesn't exist.

**Per-project discoverability**: Each doc plugin has its own navigate skill with a specific description (e.g., "Find ClickHouse documentation for data modeling, ETL, query optimization").

**Centralized refresh**: One `docs-refresh` skill works across all doc plugins.

## Example: ClickHouse Docs

```
clickhouse-docs/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
├── skills/navigate/SKILL.md     # "Find ClickHouse documentation..."
├── data/
│   ├── config.yaml              # Points to ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs
│   └── index.md                 # ~150 key docs organized by topic
└── .source/                     # Local clone (gitignored)
```

The index covers:
- Data Modeling (schema design, denormalization, projections)
- Table Engines (MergeTree family, integrations)
- SQL Reference (SELECT, INSERT, data types)
- Operations (deployment, monitoring, backups)
- Integrations (Kafka, S3, dbt)

## Adding a New Documentation Source

1. Run `docs-plugin-init` with the repo URL
2. Run `docs-initial-analysis` from the new plugin directory
3. Collaborate on index contents
4. Commit `data/index.md` and `data/config.yaml`

The navigate skill is immediately usable. Run `docs-refresh` periodically to check for upstream changes.

## Repository Organization

This repository contains the **meta-plugin** (skills for generating and maintaining doc plugins) plus **one reference implementation** (clickhouse-docs). Generated documentation plugins should live in their own repositories.

### Why separate repos?

**Indexes are personal.** The collaborative index you build reflects *your* priorities and use cases. Someone focused on ClickHouse analytics has different needs than someone building ETL pipelines. A centralized collection of "everyone's indexes" has limited value.

**Independent lifecycles.** Your doc plugin updates when *you* need it updated, not when someone else changes theirs.

**Lightweight installation.** Users install only the doc plugins they actually use.

### Recommended approach

| Repository | Contents |
|------------|----------|
| This repo | Meta-plugin skills + templates + reference implementation |
| `your-org/prisma-docs` | Your Prisma documentation plugin |
| `your-org/react-docs` | Your React documentation plugin |

### The clickhouse-docs example

The `clickhouse-docs/` directory serves as:
- A working reference implementation
- A test case for meta-plugin changes
- An example of index structure and organization

Feel free to use it directly, or use it as a template for your own plugins.
