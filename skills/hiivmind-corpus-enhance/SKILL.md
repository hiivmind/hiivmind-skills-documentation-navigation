# Corpus Index Enhancement

Expand and deepen specific sections of an existing corpus index. Can search across all sources or focus on specific ones.

## Prerequisites

Run from within a corpus skill directory. Valid locations:

| Destination Type | Location |
|------------------|----------|
| User-level skill | `~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/` |
| Repo-local skill | `{repo}/.claude-plugin/skills/{skill-name}/` |
| Single-corpus plugin | `{plugin-root}/` (with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) |
| Multi-corpus plugin | `{marketplace}/{plugin-name}/` |

Requires:
- `data/config.yaml` with at least one source configured
- `data/index.md` with real entries (run `hiivmind-corpus-build` first)

**Note:** This skill enhances index *depth*, not *freshness*. Use `hiivmind-corpus-refresh` to sync with upstream changes.

## When to Use vs Other Skills

| Situation | Use This Skill? | Instead Use |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Initial index was shallow on a topic | ✅ Yes | - |
| Need more detail on a feature | ✅ Yes | - |
| Want to reorganize or add subsections | ✅ Yes | - |
| Upstream docs have changed | ❌ No | `hiivmind-corpus-refresh` |
| Want to add a new source (git/local/web) | ❌ No | `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` |
| Corpus has no sources yet | ❌ No | `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` |
| First-time index building | ❌ No | `hiivmind-corpus-build` |

## Process

```
1. VALIDATE  →  2. READ INDEX  →  3. ASK USER  →  4. EXPLORE  →  5. ENHANCE  →  6. SAVE
```

---

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

Before proceeding, verify the corpus is ready for enhancement:

```bash
# Read config
cat data/config.yaml
```

**Check 1: Sources exist**
- If `sources:` array is empty → **STOP**: Run `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` to add sources first
- If sources exist → Continue

**Check 2: Index exists**
```bash
cat data/index.md
```
- If only placeholder text ("Run hiivmind-corpus-build...") → **STOP**: Run `hiivmind-corpus-build` first
- If index has real entries → Continue

---

## Step 2: Read Index

Load the current index to understand existing coverage:

```bash
cat data/index.md
```

### Detect Index Structure

Check if this is a **tiered index** (for large corpora):

```bash
# Check for sub-index files
ls data/index-*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Single index:** Only `data/index.md` exists
**Tiered index:** Multiple files like `data/index.md`, `data/index-reference.md`, `data/index-guides.md`

For tiered indexes:
- Main `index.md` contains section summaries and links to sub-indexes
- Sub-indexes contain detailed entries for each section
- User may want to enhance main index OR a specific sub-index

Ask user: "This corpus uses tiered indexing. Do you want to enhance the main index overview, or a specific section like `index-reference.md`?"

### Identify Enhancement Opportunities

- Current sections and their depth
- Topics with minimal entries
- Areas that could benefit from subsections
- Sections that link to sub-indexes (tiered only)

---

## Step 3: Ask User

Present the current structure and ask:

1. **Which topic to enhance?**
   - "Which section would you like to expand?"
   - "Is there a specific feature or concept you need more detail on?"

2. **What's the goal?**
   - "What are you trying to accomplish with this topic?"
   - "Any specific questions you want the index to help answer?"

3. **Desired depth?**
   - "Should I find all related docs, or focus on the essentials?"
   - "Do you want subsections, or just more entries?"

---

## Step 4: Explore

Search for relevant documentation not yet in the index.

### Identify Target Sources

Based on user's topic, determine which source(s) to explore:
- Specific source if user mentioned it
- All sources if topic is cross-cutting
- Read `data/config.yaml` to see available sources

### Search by Source Type

**Git sources** (`.source/{source_id}/`):
```bash
# Find docs in the target area
find .source/{source_id}/{docs_root}/{topic_path} -name "*.md" -o -name "*.mdx"

# Search for related content
grep -r "{keyword}" .source/{source_id}/{docs_root} --include="*.md" -l

# Read promising files
head -50 .source/{source_id}/{docs_root}/path/to/file.md
```

If no local clone, use raw GitHub URLs:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{docs_root}/{path}
```

**Local sources** (`data/uploads/{source_id}/`):
```bash
# Find docs
find data/uploads/{source_id} -name "*.md" -o -name "*.mdx"

# Search content
grep -r "{keyword}" data/uploads/{source_id} --include="*.md" -l
```

**Web sources** (`.cache/web/{source_id}/`):
```bash
# Search cached content
grep -r "{keyword}" .cache/web/{source_id} --include="*.md" -l

# Read cached files
cat .cache/web/{source_id}/{filename}.md
```

### Cross-Source Discovery

If the topic spans multiple sources, search all and group findings by source:

```
Found related content in 2 sources:

react (git):
- src/content/reference/useCallback.md
- src/content/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect.md

kent-testing-blog (web):
- testing-implementation-details.md (discusses React testing patterns)
```

### What to Look For

- Files not currently in the index
- Sections within files that deserve separate entries
- Related docs that could be grouped together
- Anchor points (#headings) for specific topics within large files
- Cross-source connections (e.g., blog post explaining library feature)
- **Large structured files** that need special handling (see below)

### Detecting Large Structured Files

When enhancing, check if any discovered files are too large to read:

```bash
wc -l {file_path}
```

**If file > 1000 lines**, mark it with `⚡ GREP` in the index:

```markdown
- **OpenAPI Spec** `api-docs:openapi.yaml` ⚡ GREP - Full API spec (5k lines). Search with: `grep -n "/users" ... -A 20`
```

Common patterns for large file types:

| File Type | Search Pattern |
|-----------|----------------|
| GraphQL | `grep -n "^type {Name}" file -A 30` |
| OpenAPI | `grep -n "/{path}" file -A 20` |
| JSON Schema | `grep -n '"{property}"' file -A 10` |

---

## Step 5: Enhance

Update `data/index.md` (or target sub-index file) collaboratively:

### Enhancement Patterns

All paths use the format: `{source_id}:{relative_path}`

**Adding entries to existing section:**
```markdown
## Existing Section
*Current description*

- **Existing Doc** `react:reference/hooks.md` - Description
- **New Doc** `react:reference/useCallback.md` - Added description
- **Blog Post** `web:kent-blog/you-might-not-need-effect.md` - External perspective
```

**Adding subsections:**
```markdown
## React Hooks
*Hook patterns and usage*

### Core Hooks
- **useState** `react:reference/useState.md` - State management
- **useEffect** `react:reference/useEffect.md` - Side effects

### Performance Hooks
- **useMemo** `react:reference/useMemo.md` - Memoized values
- **useCallback** `react:reference/useCallback.md` - Memoized callbacks
```

**Adding anchor links for specificity:**
```markdown
- **Settings - Performance** `polars:reference/settings.md#performance` - Runtime tuning
- **Settings - Memory** `polars:reference/settings.md#memory` - Memory configuration
```

**Cross-source topic grouping:**
```markdown
## Testing Best Practices
*Combined from official docs and blog posts*

- **Testing Overview** `react:learn/testing.md` - Official testing guide
- **Implementation Details** `web:kent-blog/testing-implementation-details.md` - What not to test
- **Our Testing Standards** `local:team-standards/testing.md` - Team conventions
```

### Iteration

- Show proposed changes to user
- "Does this capture what you need?"
- "Should I go deeper on any of these?"
- "Any docs here that aren't actually useful?"
- "Should I group these by source or by subtopic?"

---

## Step 6: Save

Update target index file(s) with enhancements.

**Do NOT update** `last_commit_sha` in config - that's for `hiivmind-corpus-refresh`.

### For Single Index
```bash
git add data/index.md
git commit -m "Enhance {topic} section in docs index"
```

### For Tiered Index
```bash
# If enhanced main index
git add data/index.md
# If enhanced sub-index
git add data/index-{section}.md
# If both
git add data/index.md data/index-{section}.md

git commit -m "Enhance {topic} section in docs index"
```

---

## Next Steps Guidance

After enhancement, suggest appropriate next actions:

| Situation | Recommend |
|-----------|-----------|
| User mentions wanting to add new docs from a different repo | `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` |
| User asks about upstream changes | `hiivmind-corpus-refresh` |
| Enhanced section now feels too large | Consider tiered indexing (see `hiivmind-corpus-build`) |
| Index is still shallow in other areas | Run `hiivmind-corpus-enhance` again on those sections |

### Tiered Index Enhancement

**User**: "Enhance the Actions section of my GitHub docs corpus"

**Step 1**: Validate prerequisites - all pass
**Step 2**: Read index
- Found `data/index.md` with tiered structure
- Found `data/index-actions.md` sub-index linked from main index
- Ask user: "This corpus uses tiered indexing. Do you want to enhance the main index Actions summary, or the detailed `index-actions.md`?"

User: "The detailed actions sub-index"

**Step 3**: Ask user what they need
- User: "I need more coverage of reusable workflows"

**Step 4**: Explore `.source/github/actions/using-workflows/` for reusable workflow docs
- Found 5 additional files not in current index

**Step 5**: Propose additions to `data/index-actions.md`:
```markdown
### Reusable Workflows
- **Creating reusable workflows** `github:actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows.md` - Build once, use everywhere
- **Calling reusable workflows** `github:actions/using-workflows/calling-reusable-workflows.md` - Using workflows from other repos
- **Workflow inputs and outputs** `github:actions/using-workflows/workflow-inputs-outputs.md` - Passing data between workflows
```

**Step 6**: Save `data/index-actions.md`, remind to commit

---

### Blocked: No Sources Configured

**User**: "Enhance the API section"

**Step 1**: Validate prerequisites
- Read config: `sources:` array is empty

**Response**: "This corpus doesn't have any sources configured yet. You need to add documentation sources before enhancement is possible.

**Recommended next step:** Run `hiivmind-corpus-add-source` to add a git repo, local files, or web pages."
